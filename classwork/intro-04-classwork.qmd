We recommend restarting R between each slide deck!

## Setup

Setup from deck 3

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(forested)

set.seed(123)
forested_split <- initial_split(forested, prop = 0.8, strata = forested)
forested_train <- training(forested_split)
forested_test <- testing(forested_split)

# decrease cost_complexity from its default 0.01 to make a more
# complex and performant tree. see `?decision_tree()` to learn more.
tree_spec <- decision_tree(cost_complexity = 0.0001, mode = "classification")
forested_wflow <- workflow(forested ~ ., tree_spec)
forested_fit <- fit(forested_wflow, forested_train)
```

## Metrics for model performance

`conf_mat()` can be used to see how well the model is doing at prediction

```{r}
augment(forested_fit, new_data = forested_train) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = forested, estimate = .pred_class)
```

and it has nice plotting features

```{r}
augment(forested_fit, new_data = forested_train) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = forested, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

using the same interface we can calculate metrics

```{r}
augment(forested_fit, new_data = forested_train) %>%
  accuracy(truth = forested, estimate = .pred_class)
```

Metric sets are a way to combine multiple similar metric functions together into a new function.

```{r}
forested_metrics <- metric_set(accuracy, specificity, sensitivity)

augment(forested_fit, new_data = forested_train) %>%
  forested_metrics(truth = forested, estimate = .pred_class)
```

Metrics and metric sets work with grouped data frames!

```{r}
augment(forested_fit, new_data = forested_train) %>%
  group_by(tree_no_tree) %>%
  accuracy(truth = forested, estimate = .pred_class)
```

## Your turn

Apply the `forested_metrics` metric set to `augment()` output grouped by `tree_no_tree`.

```{r}
# Your code here!

```

Do any metrics differ substantially between groups?

## Your turn

Compute and plot an ROC curve for your current model.

What data are being used for this ROC curve plot?

```{r}
# Your code here!

```

## Dangers of overfitting

Repredicting the training set, bad!

```{r}
forested_fit %>%
  augment(forested_train)
```

"Resubstitution estimate" - This should be the best possible performance that you could ever achieve, but it can be very misleading!

```{r}
forested_fit %>%
  augment(forested_train) %>%
  accuracy(forested, .pred_class)
```

Now on the test set, see that it performs worse? This is closer to "real" performance.

```{r}
forested_fit %>%
  augment(forested_test) %>%
  accuracy(forested, .pred_class)
```

## Your turn

Use `augment()` and and a metric function to compute a classification metric like `brier_class()`.

Compute the metrics for both training and testing data to demonstrate overfitting!

Notice the evidence of overfitting!

```{r}
# Your code here!

# Use `augment()` and `brier_class()` with `forested_fit`
forested_fit
```

## Your turn

If we use 10 folds, what percent of the training data:

- ends up in analysis?
- ends up in assessment?

for each fold

## Resampling

```{r}
# v = 10 is the default
vfold_cv(forested_train)
```

What is in a resampling result?

```{r}
forested_folds <- vfold_cv(forested_train, v = 10)

# Individual splits of analysis/assessment data
forested_folds$splits[1:3]
```

Stratification often helps, with very little downside

```{r}
vfold_cv(forested_train, strata = forested)
```

We'll use this setup:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
forested_folds <- vfold_cv(forested_train, v = 10, strata = forested)
forested_folds
```

## Evaluating model performance

```{r}
# Fit the workflow on each analysis set,
# then compute performance on each assessment set
forested_res <- fit_resamples(forested_wflow, forested_folds)
forested_res
```

Aggregate metrics

```{r}
forested_res %>%
  collect_metrics()
```

If you want to analyze the assessment set (i.e. holdout) predictions, then you need to adjust the control object and tell it to save them:

```{r}
# Save the assessment set results
ctrl_forested <- control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)

forested_res <- fit_resamples(forested_wflow, forested_folds, control = ctrl_forested)

forested_preds <- collect_predictions(forested_res)
forested_preds
```

## Bootstrapping

```{r}
set.seed(3214)
bootstraps(forested_train)
```

## Your turn

Create:

- Monte Carlo Cross-Validation sets
- validation set

(use the reference guide to find the functions)

https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html

Don't forget to set a seed when you resample!

```{r}
# Your code here!

```

## Create a random forest model

```{r}
rf_spec <- rand_forest(trees = 1000, mode = "classification")
rf_spec
```

```{r}
rf_wflow <- workflow(forested ~ ., rf_spec)
rf_wflow
```

## Your turn

Use `fit_resamples()` and `rf_wflow` to:

- Keep predictions
- Compute metrics

```{r}
# Your code here!

```

## Evaluate a workflow set

```{r}
wf_set <- workflow_set(list(forested ~ .), list(tree_spec, rf_spec))
wf_set
```

```{r}
wf_set_fit <- wf_set %>%
  workflow_map("fit_resamples", resamples = forested_folds)

wf_set_fit
```

Rank the sets of models by their aggregate metric performance

```{r}
wf_set_fit %>%
  rank_results()
```

## Your turn

When do you think a workflow set would be useful?

Discuss with your neighbors!

## The final fit

```{r}
# `forested_split` has train + test info
final_fit <- last_fit(rf_wflow, forested_split) 

final_fit
```

Test set metrics:

```{r}
collect_metrics(final_fit)
```

Test set predictions:

```{r}
collect_predictions(final_fit)
```

```{r}
collect_predictions(final_fit) %>%
  ggplot(aes(.pred_class, fill = forested)) + 
  geom_bar() 
```

```{r}
extract_workflow(final_fit)
```

## Your turn

Which model do you think you would decide to use?

What surprised you the most?

If you're taking Advanced tidymodels tomorrow, what is one thing you are looking forward to learning?
