We recommend restarting R between each slide deck!

## Setup

Setup from deck 3

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(forested)

set.seed(123)
forested_split <- initial_split(forested, prop = 0.8)
forested_train <- training(forested_split)
forested_test <- testing(forested_split)
```

## Your turn

Take the recipe and `prep()` then `bake()` it to see what the resulting data set looks like.

`step_other()` has an argument `threshold` that defaults to `0.05`. Change it to see what happens to the number of columns.

Try removing steps to see how the results changes.

```{r}
rec_spec <- recipe(forested ~ ., data = forested_train) %>%  
  step_other(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%  
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%  
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>%  
  step_log(canopy_cover, offset = 0.5) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())
```
