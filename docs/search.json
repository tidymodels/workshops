This workshop provides an introduction to machine learning with R using the tidymodels framework, a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. We will build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models. Along the way, we’ll learn about key concepts in machine learning including overfitting, resampling, and feature engineering. Learners will gain knowledge about good predictive modeling practices, as well as hands-on experience using tidymodels packages like parsnip, rsample, recipes, yardstick, tune, and workflows."

That is mostly because of the validation set. In every other case, the situation is much more simple.\nIn a later section, we will talk about methods of resampling. These methods are like repeated validation sets. As an example, the popular 10-fold cross-validation method is one such type of resampling. Validation sets are special cases of resampling where there is a single “resample”.\nMost types of resampling use multiple hold-out sets of samples from the training set. In those cases, a diagram for data usage here would look like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case there is just “testing” and “training”.

The matrix in question is called the “model matrix” and it contains the predictor set for the training data.\nMatrix inverse can fail if two or model columns:\n\nare identical, or\nadd up to some other column.\n\nThese situations are called linear dependencies.\nWhen this happens, lm() is pretty tolerant. It does not fail but does not compute regression coefficients for a minimal number of predictors involved in the dependency (and issues the warning above).\nFor these data, there are three dependencies between:\n\ndefense_team_PIT and offense_team_PIT\nstrength_short_handed, player_diff, and strength_power_play\nyear, month_Oct, month_Nov, and month_Dec\n\nThe first one is easy to explain. For each row, when one these two PIT column has a one, the other must have a zero. The linear regression intercept is represented in the model matrix as a column of all ones. The dependency is\n(Intercept) = defense_team_PIT + offense_team_PIT\nThe way to avoid this problem is to use step_lincomb(all_numeric_predictors()) in the recipe. This step removes the minimum number of columns to avoid the issue.\ntl;dr\nLinear regression detects some redundancies in the predictor set. We can ignore the warnings since lm() can deal with it or use step_lincomb() to avoid the warnings."

    "text": "Data splitting and spending \nWhat does set.seed() do?\nWe’ll use pseudo-random numbers (PRN) to partition the data into training and testing. PRN are numbers that emulate truly random numbers (but really are not truly random).\nThink of PRN as a box that takes a starting value (the “seed”) that produces random numbers using that starting value as an input into its process.\nIf we know a seed value, we can reproduce our “random” numbers. To use a different set of random numbers, choose a different seed value.\nFor example:\n\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n\n#> [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n# Get a new set or random numbers:\nset.seed(2)\nrunif(3)\n\n#> [1] 0.1848823 0.7023740 0.5733263\n\n# We can reproduce the old ones with the same seed\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n\n#> [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n\nIf we don’t set the seeds, programs use the clock time as the seed. This isn’t reproducible.\nSince we want our code to be reproducible, we set the seeds before random numbers are used.\nIn theory, you can set the seed once at the start of a script. However, if we do interactive data analysis, we might unwittingly use random numbers while coding. In that case, the stream is not the same and we don’t get reproducible results.\nThe value of the seed is an integer and really has no meaning. MAx has a script to generate random integers to use as seeds to “spread the randomness around”. It is basically\n\ncat(paste0(\"set.seed(\", sample.int(10000, 5), \")\", collapse = \"\\n\"))\n\n#> set.seed(9725)\n#> set.seed(8462)\n#> set.seed(4050)\n#> set.seed(8789)\n#> set.seed(1301)"
