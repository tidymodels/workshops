This workshop provides an introduction to machine learning with R using the tidymodels framework, a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. We will build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models. Along the way, we’ll learn about key concepts in machine learning including overfitting, resampling, and feature engineering. Learners will gain knowledge about good predictive modeling practices, as well as hands-on experience using tidymodels packages like parsnip, rsample, recipes, yardstick, tune, and workflows."

We don’t want people to have to frantically scribble down things that we say that are not on the slides.\nWe’ve added sections to this document with longer explanations and links to other resources.\n\n\n\nThis is a pretty complex data usage scheme. That is mostly because of the validation set. In every other case, the situation is much more simple.\nThe important point here is that: tidymodels does most of this work for you. In other words, you don’t have to directly specify which data are being used where.\nIn a later section, we will talk about methods of resampling. These methods are like repeated validation sets. As an example, the popular 10-fold cross-validation method is one such type of resampling. Validation sets are special cases of resampling where there is a single “resample”.\nMost types of resampling use multiple hold-out sets of samples from the training set. In those cases, a diagram for data usage here would look like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case there is just “testing” and “training”. Once the final model is determined, the entire training set is used for the last fit.\nThis is the process that will be used for the tree frog data."

    "text": "Data splitting and spending\nWhat does set.seed() do?\nWe’ll use pseudo-random numbers (PRN) to partition the data into training and testing. PRN are numbers that emulate truly random numbers (but really are not truly random).\nThink of PRN as a box that takes a starting value (the “seed”) that produces random numbers using that starting value as an input into its process.\nIf we know a seed value, we can reproduce our “random” numbers. To use a different set of random numbers, choose a different seed value.\nFor example:\n\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n\n#> [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n# Get a new set of random numbers:\nset.seed(2)\nrunif(3)\n\n#> [1] 0.1848823 0.7023740 0.5733263\n\n# We can reproduce the old ones with the same seed\nset.seed(1)\nrunif(3)\n\n#> [1] 0.2655087 0.3721239 0.5728534\n\n\nIf we don’t set the seed, R uses the clock time and the process ID to create a seed. This isn’t reproducible.\nSince we want our code to be reproducible, we set the seeds before random numbers are used.\nIn theory, you can set the seed once at the start of a script. However, if we do interactive data analysis, we might unwittingly use random numbers while coding. In that case, the stream is not the same and we don’t get reproducible results.\nThe value of the seed is an integer and really has no meaning. Max has a script to generate random integers to use as seeds to “spread the randomness around”.

Depending on the what was done with the data, consequences in doing that could be:\n\nYour performance metrics are slightly-to-moderately optimistic (e.g. you might think your accuracy is 85% when it is actually 75%)\nA consequential component of the analysis is not right and the model just doesn’t work.\n\nThe big issue here is that you won’t be able to figure this out until you get a new piece of data, such as the test set.\nA really good example of this is in ‘Selection bias in gene extraction on the basis of microarray gene-expression data’. The authors re-analyze a previous publication and show that the original researchers did not include feature selection in the workflow. Because of that, their performance statistics were extremely optimistic. In one case, they could do the original analysis on complete noise and still achieve zero errors.\nGenerally speaking, this problem is referred to as data leakage.

For example, if we ever had an argument that was the number of degrees of freedom for a \\(t\\) distribution, we would call that argument deg_free.\nFor splines, we probably want a wider range for the degrees of freedom. We made a specialized function called spline_degree() to be used in these cases.\nHow can you tell when this happens?

The matrix in question is called the “model matrix” and it contains the predictor set for the training data.\nMatrix inverse can fail if two or model columns:\n\nare identical, or\nadd up to some other column.\n\nThese situations are called linear dependencies.\nWhen this happens, lm() is pretty tolerant. It does not fail but does not compute regression coefficients for a minimal number of predictors involved in the dependency (and issues the warning above).\nFor these data, there are three dependencies between:\n\ndefense_team_PIT and offense_team_PIT\nstrength_short_handed, player_diff, and strength_power_play\nyear, month_Oct, month_Nov, and month_Dec\n\nThe first one is easy to explain. For each row, when one these two PIT column has a one, the other must have a zero. The linear regression intercept is represented in the model matrix as a column of all ones. The dependency is\n(Intercept) = defense_team_PIT + offense_team_PIT\nThe way to avoid this problem is to use step_lincomb(all_numeric_predictors()) in the recipe. This step removes the minimum number of columns to avoid the issue.\ntl;dr\nLinear regression detects some redundancies in the predictor set.
