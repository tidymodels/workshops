We recommend restarting R between each slide deck!

## Setup

Setup

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(forested)

set.seed(123)
forested_split <- initial_split(forested, prop = 0.8)
forested_train <- training(forested_split)
forested_test <- testing(forested_split)

set.seed(123)
forested_folds <- vfold_cv(forested_train, v = 10)

# decrease cost_complexity from its default 0.01 to make a more
# complex and performant tree. see `?decision_tree()` to learn more.
tree_spec <- decision_tree(cost_complexity = 0.0001, mode = "classification")
rf_spec <- rand_forest(trees = 1000, mode = "classification")
```

## Evaluate a workflow set

```{r}
wf_set <- workflow_set(list(forested ~ .), list(tree_spec, rf_spec))
wf_set
```

```{r}
wf_set_fit <- wf_set %>%
  workflow_map("fit_resamples", resamples = forested_folds)
wf_set_fit
```

Rank the sets of models by their aggregate metric performance

```{r}
wf_set_fit %>%
  rank_results()
```

## Your turn

When do you think a workflow set would be useful?
