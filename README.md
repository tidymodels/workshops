# workshops

This repo contains tutorial materials for machine learning with [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/).

## Organization

This repo is organized into directories:

-   `slides/` has Quarto files for the latest version of our slides.
-   `classwork/` contains Quarto files prepared for you to work along with the slides.
-   `archive/` is the location for older versions of this workshop.

## Archiving Notes

To archive previous workshop notes:

* Make a subdirectory in `archive/` called `YYYY-MM-workshop-name`.
* Copy the contents of `slides/` into `archive/YYYY-MM-workshop-name`.
* Copy the contents of `classwork/` into `archive/YYYY-MM-workshop-name/classwork`.
* Copy `index.qmd` into `archive/YYYY-MM-workshop-name`.
* In `index.qmd`, remove `slides/` from links to slides.
* In `_quarto.yml`:
	* add an entry `"archive/YYYY-MM-workshop-name/*qmd"` under `render`.
	* add an entry `"archive/YYYY-MM-workshop-name/classwork/*qmd"` under `resources`.
* In `archive/YYYY-MM-workshop-name/`, add a `_metadata.yml` file with the contents
```
execute:
  freeze: true
```
* In the command line, run `quarto render archive/YYYY-MM-workshop-name`. This will regenerate the workshop slides under `docs/archive/YYYY-MM-workshop-name`.
* Check that:
	* Running `quarto render` didn't change any files in `docs/` other than `index.html`, `sitemap.xml`, and `search.json` outside of `docs/archive/`.
	* The generated slides are added to `_freeze/archive/YYYY-MM-workshop-name` rather than in `archive/YYYY-MM-workshop-name`. 
	* The generated slides work (specifically, that filepaths to figures function correctly.)
* In `index.qmd`, add an entry in H2 "Past workshops" like `[M YYYY](archive/YYYY-MM-workshop-name/index.html) in workshop-name`
* If you are adding slides other than English, update the navbar link in `_quarto.yml`.

Once the above changes are merged to `main`, make a GitHub Release noting the big-picture changes since the previous iteration of the workshop.
