```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
#| file: setup.R
```

```{r setup-previous}
#| echo: false
library(tidymodels)
library(forested)

set.seed(123)
forested_split <- initial_split(forested, prop = 0.8)
forested_train <- training(forested_split)
forested_test <- testing(forested_split)

set.seed(123)
forested_folds <- vfold_cv(forested_train, v = 10)

tree_spec <- decision_tree(mode = "classification")
forested_wflow <- workflow(forested ~ ., tree_spec)
forested_fit <- fit(forested_wflow, forested_train)

rf_spec <- rand_forest(trees = 1000, mode = "classification")
```


## How can we compare multiple model workflows at once?

```{r forest-mountain, echo = FALSE}
#| fig-align: "center"

knitr::include_graphics("images/forest_mountain.svg")
```

## Evaluate a workflow set

```{r workflow-set}
workflow_set(list(forested ~ .), list(tree_spec, rf_spec))
```

## Evaluate a workflow set

```{r workflow-map}
workflow_set(list(forested ~ .), list(tree_spec, rf_spec)) %>%
  workflow_map("fit_resamples", resamples = forested_folds)
```

## Evaluate a workflow set

```{r rank-results}
workflow_set(list(forested ~ .), list(tree_spec, rf_spec)) %>%
  workflow_map("fit_resamples", resamples = forested_folds) %>%
  rank_results()
```

The first metric of the metric set is used for ranking. Use `rank_metric` to change that.

. . .

Lots more available with workflow sets, like `collect_metrics()`, `autoplot()` methods, and more!

*When do you think a workflow set would be useful?*

```{r ex-discuss-workflow-sets}
