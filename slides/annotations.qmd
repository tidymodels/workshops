# 01 - Introduction

## `r emo::ji("eyes")`

This page contains _annotations_ for selected slides. 

There's a lot that we want to tell you. We don't want people to have to frantically scribble down things that we say that are not on the slides. 

We'll add sections to this document with longer explanations and links to other resources. 



## Finalize and verify

This is a pretty complex data usage scheme. That is mostly because of the validation set. 

In a later section, we will talk about methods of [resampling](https://www.tmwr.org/resampling.html). These methods are like repeated validation sets. As an example, the popular 10-fold cross-validation method is one such type of resampling. Validation sets are [special cases of resampling](https://www.tmwr.org/resampling.html#validation) where there is a single "resample". 

Most types of resampling use multiple hold-out sets of samples from the training set. In those cases, a diagram for data usage here would look like 

```{r resampling-diagram}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-width: 50
knitr::include_graphics("images/whole-game-final-resamples.svg")
```

In this case there is just "testing" and "training". Once the final model is determined, the entire training set is used for the last fit.
