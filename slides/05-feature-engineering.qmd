## Working with our predictors

We might want to modify our predictors columns for a few reasons: 

::: {.incremental}
- The model requires them in a different format (e.g. dummy variables for `lm()`).
- The model needs certain data qualities (e.g. same units for K-NN).
- The outcome is better predicted when one or more columns are transformed in some way (a.k.a "feature engineering"). 
:::

. . .

The first two reasons are fairly predictable ([next page](https://www.tmwr.org/pre-proc-table.html#tab:preprocessing)).

The last one depends on your modeling problem.

## What is feature engineering?

Think of a feature as some *representation* of a predictor that will be used in a model.

. . .

Example representations:

-   Interactions
-   Polynomial expansions/splines
-   PCA feature extraction

There are a lot of examples in [_Feature Engineering and Selection_](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/).



## Example: Dates

How can we represent date columns for our model?

. . .

When a date column is used in its native format, it is usually converted by an R model to an integer.

. . .

It can be re-engineered as:

-   Days since a reference date
-   Day of the week
-   Month
-   Year
-   Indicators for holidays

::: notes
The main point is that we try to maximize performance with different versions of the predictors. 

Mention that, for the Chicago data, the day or the week features are usually the most important ones in the model.
:::

## General definitions `r hexes("recipes")`

-   *Data preprocessing* steps allow your model to fit.

-   *Feature engineering* steps help the model do the least work to predict the outcome as well as possible.

The recipes package can handle both!

In a little bit, we'll see successful (and unsuccessful) feature engineering methods for our example data. 


::: notes
These terms are often used interchangeably in the ML community but we want to distinguish them.
:::

## The NHL data 🏒

-   From Pittsburgh Penguins games, `r format(nrow(ongoal::season_2015), big.mark = ",")` shots

-   Data from the 2015-2016 season

. . .

Let's predict whether a shot is on-goal (a goal or blocked by goaltender) or not.

## Case study

```{r hello-tidymodels}
library(tidymodels)
library(ongoal)

tidymodels_prefer()

glimpse(season_2015)
```

## Data splitting strategy

```{r spending-diagram, echo = FALSE}
#| fig-align: "center"

knitr::include_graphics("images/whole-game-split.svg")
```


## Why a validation set?

Recall that resampling gives us performance measures without using the test set. 

It's important to get good resampling statistics (e.g. $R^2$). 

 - That usually means having enough data to estimate performance. 

When you have "a lot" of data, a validation set can be an efficient way to do this. 


## Splitting the NHL data `r hexes("rsample")` {.annotation}

```{r split}
set.seed(23)
nhl_split <- initial_split(season_2015, prop = 3/4)
nhl_split

nhl_train_and_val <- training(nhl_split)
nhl_test  <- testing(nhl_split)

## not testing
nrow(nhl_train_and_val)
 
## testing
nrow(nhl_test)
```

## Validation split `r hexes("rsample")`

Since there are a lot of observations, we'll use a validation set: 

```{r val}
set.seed(234)
nhl_val <- validation_split(nhl_train_and_val, prop = 0.80)
nhl_val
```

. . .

Remember that a validation split is a type of resample.

## Prepare your data for modeling `r hexes("recipes")`

- The recipes package is an extensible framework for pipeable sequences of feature engineering steps that provide preprocessing tools to be applied to data.

. . .

- Statistical parameters for the steps can be _estimated_ from an initial data set and then _applied_ to other data sets.

. . .

- The resulting processed output can be used as inputs for statistical or machine learning models.

## A first recipe `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r base-recipe}
nhl_rec <- 
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train)
```

. . .

- The `recipe()` function assigns columns to roles of "outcome" or "predictor" using the formula

## A first recipe `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r rec-summary}
summary(nhl_rec)
```

## Create indicator variables `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
nhl_rec <- 
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())
```

. . .

- For any factor or character predictors, make binary indicators.

- There are *many* recipe steps that can convert categorical predictors to numeric columns.

## Filter out constant columns `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
nhl_rec <- 
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors())
```

. . .

In case there is a factor level that was never observed in the training data (resulting in a column of all `0`s), we can delete any *zero-variance* predictors that have a single unique value.

:::notes
Note that the selector chooses all columns with a role of "predictor"
:::


## Normalization `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r rec-norm}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "5"
nhl_rec <- 
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())
```

. . .

- This centers and scales the numeric predictors.


- The recipe will use the _training_ set to estimate the means and standard deviations of the data.

. . .

- All data the recipe is applied to will be normalized using those statistics (there is no re-estimation).

## Reduce correlation `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r }
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| eval: false
nhl_rec <- 
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% 
  step_corr(all_numeric_predictors(), threshold = 0.9)
```

. . .

To deal with highly correlated predictors, find the minimum set of predictor columns that make the pairwise correlations less than the threshold.

## Other possible steps `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| eval: false
nhl_rec <- 
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% 
  step_pca(all_numeric_predictors())
```

. . . 

PCA feature extraction...

## Other possible steps `r hexes("recipes", "embed")`

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| eval: false
nhl_rec <- 
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% 
  embed::step_umap(all_numeric_predictors(), outcome = on_goal)
```

. . . 

A fancy machine learning supervised dimension reduction technique...

:::notes
Note that this uses the outcome, and it is from an extension package
:::


## Other possible steps `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
nhl_rec <- 
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% 
  step_ns(coord_y, coord_x, deg_free = 10)
```

. . . 

Nonlinear transforms like natural splines, and so on!

```

# Two class data

Let's say we can define one class as the "event", like a shot being on goal.

. . .

-   The **sensitivity** is the *true positive rate* (accuracy on actual events).

-   The **specificity** is the *true negative rate* (accuracy on actual non-events, or 1 - *false positive rate*).

## Two class data

These definitions assume that we know the threshold for converting "soft" probability predictions into "hard" class predictions.

. . .

Is a 50% threshold good? 

What happens if we say that we need to be 80% sure to declare an event?

-   sensitivity ⬇️, specificity ⬆️

. . .

What happens for a 20% threshold?

-   sensitivity ⬆️, specificity ⬇️

## Varying the threshold

```{r}
#| label: thresholds
#| echo: false

glm_val_pred %>% 
  roc_curve(truth = on_goal, .pred_yes) %>% 
  filter(is.finite(.threshold)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(specificity, sensitivity), names_to = "statistic", values_to = "value") %>% 
  rename(`event threshold` = .threshold) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = `event threshold`, y = value, col = statistic, group = statistic)) + 
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(y = NULL) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

## ROC curves

To make an ROC (receiver operator characteristic) curve, we:

- calculate the sensitivity and specificity for all possible thresholds

- plot false positive rate (x-axis) versus true positive rate (y-axis)

. . .

We can use the area under the ROC curve as a classification metric: 

- ROC AUC = 1 💯 
- ROC AUC = 1/2 😢

:::notes
ROC curves are insensitive to class imbalance.
:::

## ROC curves `r hexes("yardstick")`

# Assumes _first_ factor level is event; there are options to change that

## What do we do with the player data? 🏒

There are `r length(unique(nhl_train$shooter))` unique player values in our training set. How can we include this information in our model?

. . .

We could:

-   make the full set of indicator variables 😳

-   lump players who rarely shoot into an "other" group

-   use [feature hashing](https://www.tmwr.org/categorical.html#feature-hashing) to create a smaller set of indicator variables

-   use effect encoding to replace the `shooter` column with the estimated effect of that predictor


. . .

Let's look at _othering_ then _effect encodings_.

```{r effects-calcs}
#| include: false

player_stats <- 
  nhl_train %>%
  group_by(shooter) %>%
  summarize(
    rate = mean(on_goal == "yes"), 
    num_shots = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
    ) %>%
  mutate(shooter = reorder(shooter, rate))

library(embed)

estimates <- 
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train) %>% 
  step_lencode_mixed(shooter, outcome = vars(on_goal), id = "encoding") %>%   #<<
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% 
  prep() %>% 
  tidy(id = "encoding") %>% 
  select(shooter = level, estimate = value)

before <- nhl_train %>% select(on_goal, shooter) %>% slice(1:7) %>% add_rowindex()
after <- left_join(before, estimates, by = "shooter") %>% 
  select(on_goal, shooter = estimate, .row)
```


## Per-player statistics 

::: columns

```{r effects-freq}

  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1/40, col = "red", fill = "red", alpha = 1/3) +

## Collapsing factor levels

There is a recipe step that will redefine factor levels based on the their frequency in the training set: 

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3:4"

nhl_other_rec <-
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train) %>%
  # Any player with <= 0.01% of shots is set to "other"
  step_other(shooter, threshold = 0.001) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors())
```

```{r other-res}
#| include: false

retained_shooters <-
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train) %>%
  step_mutate(original = shooter) %>% 
  step_other(shooter, threshold = 0.001) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  prep() %>% 
  tidy(number = 2)

num_shooters <- length(unique(nhl_train$shooter))
num_other <- num_shooters - length(retained_shooters$retained)
```

Using this code, `r num_other` players (out of `r num_shooters`) were collapsed into "other" based on the training set.

We _could_ try to optimize the threshold for collapsing (see the next set of slides on model tuning).

## Does othering help? 

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3|"
nhl_other_wflow <-
  nhl_glm_wflow %>%
  update_recipe(nhl_other_rec)

nhl_other_res <-
  nhl_other_wflow %>%
  fit_resamples(nhl_val, control = ctrl)

collect_metrics(nhl_other_res)
```

A little better ROC AUC and much faster to complete.  

Now let's look at a more sophisticated tool called effect encodings.

## What is an effect encoding?

We replace the qualitative’s predictor data with their _effect on the outcome_. 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Data before:

```{r before}
before
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Data after:

```{r after}
after
```

:::
:::

The `shooter` column is replaced with the log-odds of being on goal. 

:::notes
As a reminder:

$$\text{log-odds} = log\left(\frac{\hat{p}}{1 - \hat{p}}\right)$$ 

where $\hat{p}$ is the on goal rate estimate. 

For logistic regression, this is what the predictors are modeling. The log-odds are more likely to be linear with the outcome.

```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Good statistical methods for estimating these rates use *partial pooling*.


- Pooling borrows strength across players and shrinks extreme values (e.g. zero or one) towards the mean for players with very few shots.


- The embed package has recipe steps for effect encodings.

:::
:::


:::notes
Partial pooling gives better estimates for players with fewer shots by shrinking the estimate to the overall on-goal rate (`r round(mean(on_goal$on_goal == "yes") * 100, 1)`%)


:::

## Partial pooling

```{r effect-compare}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| dev: 'svglite'
#| dev-args: list(bg = "transparent")

  scale_size(range = c(1/3, 3)) +
  labs(x = "Raw Rate", y = "Estimated via Effects Encoding")
```

## Player effects `r hexes("recipes","embed")` {.annotation}

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "1,5"
library(embed)

nhl_effect_rec <-
  recipe(on_goal ~ ., data = nhl_train) %>%
  step_lencode_mixed(shooter, goaltender, outcome = vars(on_goal)) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors())
```

. . .

It is very important to appropriately validate the effect encoding step to make sure that we are not overfitting.

## Recipes are estimated `r hexes("recipes")`

Preprocessing steps in a recipe use the *training set* to compute quantities.

. . .

What kind of quantities are computed for preprocessing?

-   Levels of a factor
-   Whether a column has zero variance
-   Normalization
-   Feature extraction
-   Effect encodings

. . .

When a recipe is part of a workflow, this estimation occurs when `fit()` is called.

## Effect encoding results `r hexes("recipes","embed", "workflows", "tune")`

```{r resample-encoding}
#| code-line-numbers: "3|"
nhl_effect_wflow <-
  nhl_glm_wflow %>%
  update_recipe(nhl_effect_rec)

nhl_effect_res <-
  nhl_effect_wflow %>%
  fit_resamples(nhl_val, control = ctrl)

collect_metrics(nhl_effect_res)
```

Better and it can handle new players (if they occur).

# Where is the shot coming from? 🏒🧐 

## Angle {.annotation}

  ggtitle("coord_x <= -25.5")
```

## Behind goal line

```{r}
nhl_behind_rec <-
  nhl_zone_rec %>%
  step_mutate(
    behind_goal_line = ifelse(coord_x >= 89, 1, 0)
  )
```

```{r goal-line}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: '50%'
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| dev: 'svg'
#| dev-args: list(bg = "transparent")

example_data %>% 
  filter(behind_goal_line == 1) %>% 
  plot_nhl_shots(emphasis = on_goal, alpha = 1/2) +
  ggtitle("behind goal line")
```

## Fit different recipes `r hexes("recipes","embed", "workflows", "tune")`

A workflow set can cross models and/or preprocessors and then resample them *en masse*. 

```{r nhl-feature-sets}
#| cache: true
#| results: 'markup'

no_coord_rec <- 
  nhl_indicators %>% 
  step_rm(starts_with("coord"))

set.seed(9)

nhl_glm_set_res <-
  workflow_set(
    list(`1_no_coord` = no_coord_rec,   `2_other` = nhl_other_rec, 
         `3_effects`  = nhl_effect_rec, `4_angle` = nhl_angle_rec, 
         `5_zone`     = nhl_zone_rec,   `6_bgl`   = nhl_behind_rec),
    list(logistic = logistic_reg())
  ) %>%
  workflow_map(fn = "fit_resamples", resamples = nhl_val, verbose = TRUE, control = ctrl)
```

*Create a workflow set with 2 or 3 recipes.*

*(Consider using recipes we've already created.)*

*Use `workflow_map()` to resample the workflow set.* 

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 8, id = "hockey-wfset")
```


## Compare recipes

```{r rank-res-code}
#| eval: false
#| out-width: '70%'

library(forcats)
collect_metrics(nhl_glm_set_res) %>%
  filter(.metric == "roc_auc") %>%
  mutate(
    features = gsub("_logistic", "", wflow_id), 
    features = fct_reorder(features, mean)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean, y = features)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(y = NULL, x = "ROC AUC (validation set)")
```

## Debugging a recipe

- Typically, you will want to use a workflow to estimate and apply a recipe.

. . .

- If you have an error and need to debug your recipe, the original recipe object (e.g. `encoded_players`) can be estimated manually with a function called `prep()`. It is analogous to `fit()`. See [TMwR section 16.4](https://www.tmwr.org/dimensionality.html#recipe-functions)

. . .

- Another function (`bake()`) is analogous to `predict()`, and gives you the processed data back.

. . .

- The `tidy()` function can be used to get specific results from the recipe.

## Example

```{r}
nhl_angle_fit <- prep(nhl_angle_rec)

tidy(nhl_angle_fit, number = 1) %>% slice(1:4)

bake(nhl_angle_fit, nhl_train %>% slice(1:3), starts_with("coord"), angle, shooter)
```

## More on recipes

-   Once `fit()` is called on a workflow, changing the model does not re-fit the recipe.

. . .

-   A list of all known steps is at <https://www.tidymodels.org/find/recipes/>.

. . .

-   Some steps can be [skipped](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/articles/Skipping.html) when using `predict()`.

. . .

-   The [order](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/articles/Ordering.html) of the steps matters.
