If you are using your own laptop instead of RStudio Cloud:

```{r load-pkgs}
#| eval: false

# Install the packages for the workshop
pkgs <- 
  c("bonsai", "doParallel", "finetune", "lightgbm", "lme4", "plumber",

## Working with our predictors

We might want to modify our predictors columns for a few reasons: 

::: {.incremental}
- The model requires them in a different format (e.g. dummy variables for linear regression).
- The model needs certain data qualities (e.g. same units for K-NN).
- The outcome is better predicted when one or more columns are transformed in some way (a.k.a "feature engineering"). 
:::

. . .

The first two reasons are fairly predictable ([next page](https://www.tmwr.org/pre-proc-table.html#tab:preprocessing)).

The last one depends on your modeling problem.

## What is feature engineering?

Think of a feature as some *representation* of a predictor that will be used in a model.

. . .

Example representations:

-   Interactions
-   Polynomial expansions/splines
-   Principal component analysis (PCA) feature extraction

There are a lot of examples in [_Feature Engineering and Selection_](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/) (FES).



## Example: Dates

How can we represent date columns for our model?

. . .

When we use a date column in its native format, most models in R convert it to an integer.

. . .

We can re-engineer it as:

-   Days since a reference date
-   Day of the week
-   Month
-   Year
-   Indicators for holidays

::: notes
The main point is that we try to maximize performance with different versions of the predictors. 

Mention that, for the Chicago data, the day or the week features are usually the most important ones in the model.
:::

## General definitions `r hexes("recipes")`

-   *Data preprocessing* steps allow your model to fit.

-   *Feature engineering* steps help the model do the least work to predict the outcome as well as possible.

The recipes package can handle both!

::: notes
These terms are often used interchangeably in the ML community but we want to distinguish them.
:::


## Hotel Data `r hexes("tidymodels", "dplyr")`

We'll use [data on hotels](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) to predict the cost of a room. 

The [data](https://modeldatatoo.tidymodels.org/dev/reference/data_hotel_rates.html) are in the modeldatatoo package. We'll sample down the data and refactor some columns: 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| label: tune-startup
library(tidymodels)
library(modeldatatoo)

# Max's usual settings: 
tidymodels_prefer()
theme_set(theme_bw())
options(
  pillar.advice = FALSE, 
  pillar.min_title_chars = Inf
)
```

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

```{r}
#| label: data-import
set.seed(295)
hotel_rates <- 
  data_hotel_rates() %>% 
  sample_n(5000) %>% 
  arrange(arrival_date) %>% 
  select(-arrival_date_num, -arrival_date) %>% 
  mutate(
    company = factor(as.character(company)),
    country = factor(as.character(country)),
    agent = factor(as.character(agent))
  )
```

## Data splitting strategy

```{r}
#| label: spending-diagram
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "20%"
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/initial-split.svg")
```


## Data Spending `r hexes("rsample")`

Let's split the data into a training set (75%) and testing set (25%):

```{r}
#| label: hotel-split
set.seed(4028)
hotel_split <-
  initial_split(hotel_rates, strata = avg_price_per_room)

hotel_train <- training(hotel_split)
hotel_test <- testing(hotel_split)
```



## Your turn {transition="slide-in"}

Let's take some time and investigate the _training data_. The outcome is `avg_price_per_room`. 

Are there any interesting characteristics of the data?

```{r}
#| label: hotel-investigation-exercise
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 10, id = "hotel-investigation")
```

## Resampling Strategy

```{r}
#| label: 10-fold-diagram
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/10-Fold-CV.svg")
```


## Resampling Strategy `r hexes("rsample")`

We'll use simple 10-fold cross-validation (stratified sampling):

```{r}
#| label: hotel-rs
set.seed(472)
hotel_rs <- vfold_cv(hotel_train, strata = avg_price_per_room)
hotel_rs
```


## Prepare your data for modeling `r hexes("recipes")`

- The recipes package is an extensible framework for pipeable sequences of preprocessing and feature engineering steps.

. . .

- Statistical parameters for the steps can be _estimated_ from an initial data set and then _applied_ to other data sets.

. . .

- The resulting processed output can be used as inputs for statistical or machine learning models.

## A first recipe `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| label: base-recipe
hotel_rec <- 
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train)
```

. . .

- The `recipe()` function assigns columns to roles of "outcome" or "predictor" using the formula

## A first recipe `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| label: rec-summary
summary(hotel_rec)
```

The `type` column contains information on the variables


## Your turn {transition="slide-in"}

What do you think are in the `type` vectors for the `lead_time` and `country` columns?

```{r}
#| label: var-type-exercise
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 2, id = "var-types")
```



## Create indicator variables `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| label: step-dummy
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
hotel_rec <- 
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())
```

. . .

- For any factor or character predictors, make binary indicators.

- There are *many* recipe steps that can convert categorical predictors to numeric columns.

- `step_dummy()` records the levels of the categorical predictors in the training set. 

## Filter out constant columns `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| label: step-zv
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
hotel_rec <- 
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors())
```

. . .

In case there is a factor level that was never observed in the training data (resulting in a column of all `0`s), we can delete any *zero-variance* predictors that have a single unique value.

:::notes
Note that the selector chooses all columns with a role of "predictor"
:::


## Normalization `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| label: rec-norm 
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "5"
hotel_rec <- 
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())
```

. . .

- This centers and scales the numeric predictors.


- The recipe will use the _training_ set to estimate the means and standard deviations of the data.

. . .

- All data the recipe is applied to will be normalized using those statistics (there is no re-estimation).

## Reduce correlation `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| label: corr
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| eval: false
hotel_rec <- 
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% 
  step_corr(all_numeric_predictors(), threshold = 0.9)
```

. . .

To deal with highly correlated predictors, find the minimum set of predictor columns that make the pairwise correlations less than the threshold.

## Other possible steps `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| label: pca
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| eval: false
hotel_rec <- 
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% 
  step_pca(all_numeric_predictors())
```

. . . 

PCA feature extraction...

## Other possible steps `r hexes("recipes", "embed")`

```{r}
#| label: umap
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| eval: false
hotel_rec <- 
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% 
  embed::step_umap(all_numeric_predictors(), outcome = vars(avg_price_per_room))
```

. . . 

A fancy machine learning supervised dimension reduction technique...

:::notes
Note that this uses the outcome, and it is from an extension package
:::


## Other possible steps `r hexes("recipes")`

```{r}
#| label: splines
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
hotel_rec <- 
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% 
  step_spline_natural(year_day, deg_free = 10)
```

. . . 

Nonlinear transforms like natural splines, and so on!

## Your turn {transition="slide-in"}

![](images/parsnip-flagger.jpg){.absolute top="0" right="0" width="150" height="150"}

*Create a `recipe()` for the hotel data to:*

-   *use a Yeo-Johnson (YJ) transformation on `lead_time`*
-   *convert factors to indicator variables*
-   *remove zero-variance variables*

```{r}
#| label: your-turn-make-recipe
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 3, id = "make-recipe")
```


## Minimal recipe `r hexes("recipes")` 

```{r}
#| label: hotel-rec
hotel_indicators <-
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train) %>% 
  step_YeoJohnson(lead_time) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors())
```


## Measuring Performance `r hexes("yardstick")`

We'll compute two measures: mean absolute error and the coefficient of determination (a.k.a $R^2$). 

\begin{align}
MAE &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \hat{y}_i| \notag \\
R^2 &= cor(y_i, \hat{y}_i)^2
\end{align}

The focus will be on MAE for parameter optimization. We'll use a metric set to compute these: 

```{r}
#| label: metric-set

reg_metrics <- metric_set(mae, rsq)
```


## Using a workflow `r hexes("recipes", "workflows", "parsnip", "tune")` 

```{r}
#| label: lm-model
#| cache: false

set.seed(9)

hotel_lm_wflow <-
  workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(hotel_indicators) %>%
  add_model(linear_reg())
 
ctrl <- control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
hotel_lm_res <-
  hotel_lm_wflow %>%
  fit_resamples(hotel_rs, control = ctrl, metrics = reg_metrics)

collect_metrics(hotel_lm_res)
```

## Your turn {transition="slide-in"}

![](images/parsnip-flagger.jpg){.absolute top="0" right="0" width="150" height="150"}

*Use `fit_resamples()` to fit your workflow with a recipe.*

*Collect the predictions from the results.*


```{r}
#| label: your-turn-resample-recipe
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 5, id = "resample-recipe")
```


## Holdout predictions `r hexes("recipes", "workflows", "parsnip", "tune")`

```{r}
#| label: goldout-pred
# Since we used `save_pred = TRUE`
lm_val_pred <- collect_predictions(hotel_lm_res)
lm_val_pred %>% slice(1:7)
```


## Calibration Plot `r hexes("probably")`


```{r}
#| label: lm-cal-plot
#| out-width: 40%
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-align: "center"

library(probably)

cal_plot_regression(hotel_lm_res, alpha = 1 / 5)
```



## What do we do with the agent and company data? 

There are `r length(unique(hotel_train$agent))` unique agent values and `r length(unique(hotel_train$company))` unique companies in our training set. How can we include this information in our model?

. . .

We could:

-   make the full set of indicator variables 😳

-   lump agents and companies that rarely occur into an "other" group

-   use [feature hashing](https://www.tmwr.org/categorical.html#feature-hashing) to create a smaller set of indicator variables

-   use effect encoding to replace the `agent` and `company` columns with the estimated effect of that predictor (in the extra materials)


```{r}
#| label: effects-calcs 
#| include: false

agent_stats <- 
  hotel_train %>%
  group_by(agent) %>%
  summarize(
    ADR = mean(avg_price_per_room), 
    num_reservations = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
    ) %>%
  mutate(agent = reorder(agent, ADR))
```


## Per-agent statistics 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| label: effects-freq 
#| echo: false
#| out-width: '90%'
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| dev: 'svg'
#| dev-args: list(bg = "transparent")
  
agent_stats %>%   
  ggplot(aes(x = num_reservations)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, col = "blue", fill = "blue", alpha = 1/3) +
  labs(x = "Number of reservations per agent")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| label: effects-adr 
#| echo: false
#| out-width: '90%'
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| dev: 'svg'
#| dev-args: list(bg = "transparent")

agent_stats %>%   
  ggplot(aes(x = ADR)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, col = "red", fill = "red", alpha = 1/3) +
  labs(x = "Average ADR per agent")
```
:::
:::

## Collapsing factor levels `r hexes("recipes")`

There is a recipe step that will redefine factor levels based on their frequency in the training set: 

```{r}
#| label: step-other
#| code-line-numbers: "4|"

hotel_other_rec <-
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train) %>% 
  step_YeoJohnson(lead_time) %>%
  step_other(agent, threshold = 0.001) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors())
```

```{r}
#| label: other-res 
#| include: false

retained_agents <-
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train) %>%
  step_mutate(original = agent) %>% 
  step_other(agent, threshold = 0.001) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  prep() %>% 
  tidy(number = 2)

num_agents <- length(unique(hotel_train$agent))
num_other <- num_agents - length(retained_agents$retained)
```

Using this code, `r num_other` agents (out of `r num_agents`) were collapsed into "other" based on the training set.

We _could_ try to optimize the threshold for collapsing (see the next set of slides on model tuning).

## Does othering help?  `r hexes("recipes", "tune")`

```{r}
#| label: update-recipe
#| cache: false
#| code-line-numbers: "3|"
hotel_other_wflow <-
  hotel_lm_wflow %>%
  update_recipe(hotel_other_rec)

hotel_other_res <-
  hotel_other_wflow %>%
  fit_resamples(hotel_rs, control = ctrl, metrics = reg_metrics)

collect_metrics(hotel_other_res)
```

About the same MAE and much faster to complete.  

Now let's look at a more sophisticated tool called effect feature hashing. 

## Feature Hashing

Between `agent` and `company`, simple dummy variables would create `r length(unique(hotel_train$agent)) + length(unique(hotel_train$company))` new columns (that are mostly zeros).

Another option is to have a binary indicator that combines some levels of these variables.

Feature hashing (for more see [_FES_](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/encoding-predictors-with-many-categories.html), [_SMLTAR_](https://smltar.com/mlregression.html#case-study-feature-hashing), and [_TMwR_](https://www.tmwr.org/categorical.html#feature-hashing)):  

- uses the character values of the levels 
- converts them to integer hash values
- uses the integers to assign them to a specific indicator column. 

## Feature Hashing

Suppose we want to use 32 indicator variables for `agent`. 

For a agent with value "`Max_Kuhn`", a hashing function converts it to an integer (say `r strtoi(substr(rlang::hash("Max_Kuhn"), 26, 32), 16)`). 

To assign it to one of the 32 columns, we would use modular arithmetic to assign it to a column: 

```{r}
#| label: hash

# For "Max_Kuhn" put a '1' in column: 
210397726 %% 32
```

[Hash functions](https://www.metamorphosite.com/one-way-hash-encryption-sha1-data-software) are meant to _emulate_ randomness. 


## Feature Hashing Pros


- The procedure will automatically work on new values of the predictors.
- It is fast. 
- "Signed" hashes add a sign to help avoid aliasing. 

## Feature Hashing Cons

- There is no real logic behind which factor levels are combined. 
- We don't know how many columns to add (more in the next section).
- Some columns may have all zeros. 
- If a indicator column is important to the model, we can't easily determine why. 

:::notes
The signed hash make it slightly more possible to differentiate between confounded levels
:::


## Feature Hashing in recipes `r hexes("recipes", "textrecipes", "workflows")`

The textrecipes package has a step that can be added to the recipe: 

```{r}
#| label: hash-rec
#| code-line-numbers: "6-8|"
library(textrecipes)

hash_rec <-
  recipe(avg_price_per_room ~ ., data = hotel_train) %>%
  step_YeoJohnson(lead_time) %>%
  # Defaults to 32 signed indicator columns
  step_dummy_hash(agent) %>%
  step_dummy_hash(company) %>%
  # Regular indicators for the others
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors())

hotel_hash_wflow <-
  hotel_lm_wflow %>%
  update_recipe(hash_rec)
```


## Feature Hashing in recipes `r hexes("recipes", "textrecipes", "tune")`

```{r}
#| label: hash-res
#| cache: false

hotel_hash_res <-
  hotel_hash_wflow %>%
  fit_resamples(hotel_rs, control = ctrl, metrics = reg_metrics)

collect_metrics(hotel_hash_res)
```

About the same performance but now we can handle new values. 


## Debugging a recipe

- Typically, you will want to use a workflow to estimate and apply a recipe.

. . .

- If you have an error and need to debug your recipe, the original recipe object (e.g. `hash_rec`) can be estimated manually with a function called `prep()`. It is analogous to `fit()`. See [TMwR section 16.4](https://www.tmwr.org/dimensionality.html#recipe-functions)

. . .

- Another function (`bake()`) is analogous to `predict()`, and gives you the processed data back.

. . .

- The `tidy()` function can be used to get specific results from the recipe.

## Example `r hexes("recipes", "broom")`

```{r}
#| label: prep-tidy-bake
#| eval: false
hash_rec_fit <- prep(hash_rec)

# Get the transformation coefficient
tidy(hash_rec_fit, number = 1)

# Get the processed data
bake(hash_rec_fit, hotel_train %>% slice(1:3), contains("_agent_"))
```

## More on recipes

-   Once `fit()` is called on a workflow, changing the model does not re-fit the recipe.

. . .

-   A list of all known steps is at <https://www.tidymodels.org/find/recipes/>.

. . .

-   Some steps can be [skipped](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/articles/Skipping.html) when using `predict()`.

. . .

-   The [order](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/articles/Ordering.html) of the steps matters.

```{r}
#| label: teardown
#| include: false

parallel::stopCluster(cl)

```
