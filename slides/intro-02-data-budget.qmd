## Data on Chicago taxi trips

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   The city of Chicago releases anonymized trip-level data on taxi trips in the city.
-   We pulled a sample of 10,000 rides occurring in early 2022.
-   Type `?taxi` to learn more about this dataset, including references.

## Data on Chicago taxi trips

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   `N = 10,000`
-   A nominal outcome, `tip`, with levels `"yes"` and `"no"`
-   6 other variables
    -   `company`, `local`, and `dow`, and `month` are **nominal** predictors
    -   `distance` and `hours` are **numeric** predictors

:::notes
`tip`: Whether the rider left a tip. A factor with levels "yes" and "no".

`distance`: The trip distance, in odometer miles.

`company`: The taxi company, as a factor. Companies that occurred few times were binned as "other".

`local`: Whether the trip started in the same community area as it began. See the source data for community area values.

`dow`: The day of the week in which the trip began, as a factor.

`month`: The month in which the trip began, as a factor.

`hour`: The hour of the day in which the trip began, as a numeric.

## Data on Chicago taxi trips

```{r taxi-print}
library(tidymodels)

taxi
```

## Which of these variables can we use?

```{r load}
names(taxi)
```

## Checklist for predictors

- Is it ethical to use this variable? (Or even legal?)

- Will this variable be available at prediction time?

- Does this variable contribute to explainability?

## Data splitting and spending

For machine learning, we typically split data into training and test sets:

. . .

-   The **training set** is used to estimate model parameters.
-   The **test set** is used to find an independent assessment of model performance.

. . .

Do not 🚫 use the test set during training.

## Data splitting and spending

```{r test-train-split}
#| echo: false
#| fig.width: 12
#| fig.height: 3
#| 
set.seed(123)
library(forcats)
one_split <- slice(taxi, 1:30) %>% 
  initial_split() %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  add_row(Row = 1:30, Data = "Original") %>% 
  mutate(Data = case_when(
    Data == "Analysis" ~ "Training",
    Data == "Assessment" ~ "Testing",
    TRUE ~ Data
  )) %>% 
  mutate(Data = factor(Data, levels = c("Original", "Training", "Testing")))
all_split <-
  ggplot(one_split, aes(x = Row, y = fct_rev(Data), fill = Data)) + 
  geom_tile(color = "white",
            linewidth = 1) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = splits_pal, guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(2)),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "top",
        panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  coord_equal(ratio = 1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
all_split
```

# The more data<br>we spend 🤑<br><br>the better estimates<br>we'll get.

## Data splitting and spending

-   Spending too much data in **training** prevents us from computing a good assessment of predictive **performance**.

. . .

-   Spending too much data in **testing** prevents us from computing a good estimate of model **parameters**.

*When is a good time to split your data?*

```{r ex-when-to-split}
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 3, id = "when-to-split")
```

# The testing data is precious 💎

## The initial split `r hexes("rsample")` {.annotation}

```{r taxi-split}
set.seed(123)
taxi_split <- initial_split(taxi)
taxi_split
```

:::notes
How much data in training vs testing?
This function uses a good default, but this depends on your specific goal/data
We will talk about more powerful ways of splitting, like stratification, later
:::

## What is `set.seed()`?

To create that split of the data, R generates "pseudo-random" numbers: while they are made to behave like random numbers, their generation is deterministic give a "seed".

This allows us to reproduce results by setting that seed.

Which seed you pick doesn't matter, as long as you don't try a bunch of seeds and pick the one that gives you the best performance.

## Accessing the data `r hexes("rsample")`

```{r taxi-train-test}
taxi_train <- training(taxi_split)
taxi_test <- testing(taxi_split)
```

## The training set`r hexes("rsample")`

```{r taxi-train}
taxi_train
```

## The test set `r hexes("rsample")`

🙈

. . .

There are `r nrow(taxi_test)` rows and `r ncol(taxi_test)` columns in the test set.

## Your turn {transition="slide-in"}

![](images/parsnip-flagger.jpg){.absolute top="0" right="0" width="150" height="150"}

*Split your data so 20% is held out for the test set.*

*Try out different values in `set.seed()` to see how the results change.*

```{r ex-try-splitting}
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 5, id = "try-splitting")
```

## Data splitting and spending `r hexes("rsample")`

```{r taxi-split-prop}
set.seed(123)
taxi_split <- initial_split(taxi, prop = 0.8)
taxi_train <- training(taxi_split)
taxi_test <- testing(taxi_split)

nrow(taxi_train)
nrow(taxi_test)
```

# What about a validation set?

##  {background-color="white" background-image="https://www.tmwr.org/premade/validation.svg" background-size="50%"}

## Validation set

```{r}
set.seed(123)
initial_validation_split(taxi, prop = c(0.6, 0.2))
```

*Explore the `taxi_train` data on your own!*

* *What's the distribution of the outcome, tip?*
* *What's the distribution of numeric variables like distance?*
* *How does tip differ across the categorical variables?*

::: notes
Make a plot or summary and then share with neighbor
:::

## 

```{r taxi-tip-counts}
#| fig-align: 'center'
taxi_train %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tip)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## 

```{r taxi-tip-by-local}
#| fig-align: 'center'
taxi_train %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tip, fill = local)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = .5)
```

## 

```{r taxi-tip-by-hour}
#| fig-align: 'center'
taxi_train %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, fill = tip)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## 

```{r taxi-tip-by-hour-fill}
#| fig-align: 'center'
taxi_train %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, fill = tip)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

## 

```{r taxi-tip-by-distance}
#| fig-align: 'center'
taxi_train %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = distance)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100) +
  facet_grid(vars(tip))
```

# Split smarter

##

```{r taxi-tip-pct, echo = FALSE}
taxi %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", fill = tip)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "")
```

Stratified sampling would split within response values

:::notes
Based on our EDA, we know that the source data contains fewer `"no"` tip values than `"yes"`. We want to make sure we allot equal proportions of those responses so that both the training and testing data have enough of each to give accurate estimates.
:::

## Stratification

Use `strata = tip`

```{r taxi-split-prop-strata}
set.seed(123)
taxi_split <- initial_split(taxi, prop = 0.8, strata = tip)
taxi_split
```

## Stratification

Stratification often helps, with very little downside

```{r taxi-tip-pct-by-split, echo = FALSE}
bind_rows(
  taxi_train %>% mutate(split = "train"),
  taxi_test %>% mutate(split = "test")
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = split, fill = tip)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

## The whole game - status update
