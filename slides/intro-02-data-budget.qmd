## Data on forests in Washington

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   The U.S. Forest Service maintains ML models to predict whether a plot of land is "forested."
-   This classification is important for all sorts of research, legislation, and land management purposes.
-  Plots are typically remeasured every 10 years and this dataset contains the most recent measurement per plot.
-   Type `?forested` to learn more about this dataset, including references.

## Data on forests in Washington

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   `N = 7,109` plots of land, one from each of 7,109 6000-acre hexagons in WA.
-   A nominal outcome, `forested`, with levels `"Yes"` and `"No"`, measured "on-the-ground."
-   18 remotely-sensed and easily-accessible predictors:
     - **numeric** variables based on weather and topography.
     - **nominal** variables based on classifications from other governmental orgs.

:::notes
- Those nominal variables are classifications similar to "forested" but from other agencies. e.g. `land_type` is from the European Space Agency, and is a remotely-sensed 3-class distribution based on predictions for how the land is used.
:::

## Checklist for predictors

- Is it ethical to use this variable? (Or even legal?)

- Will this variable be available at prediction time?

- Does this variable contribute to explainability?

:::notes
- re: ethics -- what issues might arise from releasing the true `lat` and `lon`? In reality, these `lat` and `lon` are slightly jittered to help ensure trust with landowners who allow surveyers to come take measurements.

## Data splitting and spending

For machine learning, we typically split data into training and test sets:

. . .

-   The **training set** is used to estimate model parameters.
-   The **test set** is used to find an independent assessment of model performance.

. . .

Do not 🚫 use the test set during training.

## Data splitting and spending

```{r test-train-split}
#| echo: false
#| fig.width: 12
#| fig.height: 3
#| 
set.seed(123)
library(forcats)
one_split <- tibble(x = 1:30) %>% 
  initial_split() %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  add_row(Row = 1:30, Data = "Original") %>% 
  mutate(Data = case_when(
    Data == "Analysis" ~ "Training",
    Data == "Assessment" ~ "Testing",
    TRUE ~ Data
  )) %>% 
  mutate(Data = factor(Data, levels = c("Original", "Training", "Testing")))
all_split <-
  ggplot(one_split, aes(x = Row, y = fct_rev(Data), fill = Data)) + 
  geom_tile(color = "white",
            linewidth = 1) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = splits_pal, guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(2)),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "top",
        panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  coord_equal(ratio = 1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
all_split
```

# The more data<br>we spend 🤑<br><br>the better estimates<br>we'll get.

## Data splitting and spending

-   Spending too much data in **training** prevents us from computing a good assessment of predictive **performance**.

. . .

-   Spending too much data in **testing** prevents us from computing a good estimate of model **parameters**.

*When is a good time to split your data?*

```{r ex-when-to-split}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, id = "when-to-split")
```

# The testing data is precious 💎

## The initial split `r hexes("rsample")` {.annotation}

```{r forested-split}
set.seed(123)
forested_split <- initial_split(forested)
forested_split
```

:::notes
How much data in training vs testing?
This function uses a good default, but this depends on your specific goal/data
We will talk about more powerful ways of splitting, like stratification, later
:::

## What is `set.seed()`?

To create that split of the data, R generates "pseudo-random" numbers: while they are made to behave like random numbers, their generation is deterministic give a "seed".

This allows us to reproduce results by setting that seed.

Which seed you pick doesn't matter, as long as you don't try a bunch of seeds and pick the one that gives you the best performance.

## Accessing the data `r hexes("rsample")`

```{r forested-train-test}
forested_train <- training(forested_split)
forested_test <- testing(forested_split)
```

## The training set`r hexes("rsample")`

```{r forested-train}
forested_train
```

## The test set `r hexes("rsample")`

🙈

. . .

There are `r nrow(forested_test)` rows and `r ncol(forested_test)` columns in the test set.

## Your turn {transition="slide-in"}

![](images/parsnip-flagger.jpg){.absolute top="0" right="0" width="150" height="150"}

*Split your data so 20% is held out for the test set.*

*Try out different values in `set.seed()` to see how the results change.*

```{r ex-try-splitting}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, id = "try-splitting")
```

## Data splitting and spending `r hexes("rsample")`

```{r forested-split-prop}
set.seed(123)
forested_split <- initial_split(forested, prop = 0.8)
forested_train <- training(forested_split)
forested_test <- testing(forested_split)

nrow(forested_train)
nrow(forested_test)
```

# What about a validation set?

## Validation set

```{r}
set.seed(123)

```

# Exploratory data analysis for ML 🧐

#| fig-align: 'center'

  ggplot(aes(x = forested)) +

  scale_color_viridis_d(end = .5)
```

TODO: should we lean into a `forested` color scheme and have green for forested, tan for not?

# Split smarter

##

```{r forested-forested-pct, echo = FALSE}
forested %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", fill = forested)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = .5)
```

Stratified sampling would split within response values

:::notes
Based on our EDA, we know that the source data contains fewer `"No"` forested values than `"Yes"`. We want to make sure we allot equal proportions of those responses so that both the training and testing data have enough of each to give accurate estimates.

TODO: this class imbalance is much less present with forested vs taxi -- should we keep it around?
:::

## Stratification

Use `strata = forested`

```{r forested-split-prop-strata}
set.seed(123)
forested_split <- initial_split(forested, prop = 0.8, strata = forested)
forested_split
```

## Stratification

Stratification often helps, with very little downside

```{r forested-forested-pct-by-split, echo = FALSE}
bind_rows(
  forested_train %>% mutate(split = "train"),
  forested_test %>% mutate(split = "test")
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = split, fill = forested)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = .5)
```

## The whole game - status update
