What if we want to compare more models?

. . .

And/or more model configurations?

. . .

And we want to understand if these are important differences?

# The testing data is precious 💎

# How can we use the *training* data to compare and evaluate different models? 🤔

*Create:*

-   *cross-validation folds with stratification*
-   *bootstrap folds (change `times` from the default)*
-   *validation resample*

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 5, id = "try-rsample")
```

## Resampling `r hexes("rsample")`

```{r}
vfold_cv(frog_train, strata = latency)

Stratification often helps, with very little downside

## Resampling `r hexes("rsample")`

```{r}
bootstraps(frog_train, times = 10)
```

## Resampling `r hexes("rsample")`

```{r}
validation_split(frog_train, strata = latency)
```

. . .

A validation split is just another type of resample

## Evaluating model performance `r hexes("rsample")`

```{r}
set.seed(123)
frog_folds <- vfold_cv(frog_train, v = 10, strata = latency)

```

Set the seed when creating resamples

## Where are the fitted models? `r hexes("tune")`  {.annotation}

```{r}
tree_res <- fit_resamples(tree_wflow, frog_folds)
tree_res
```

. . .

## Evaluating model performance `r hexes("tune")`

```{r}
tree_res %>%
  collect_metrics()

. . .

We can reliably measure performance using only the **training** data 🎉

## Comparing metrics `r hexes("yardstick")`

How do the metrics from resampling compare to the metrics from training and testing?

```{r}
#| echo: false
frog_training_rmse <-
  tree_fit %>%
  augment(frog_train) %>%
  rmse(latency, .pred) %>%
  pull(.estimate) %>%
  round(digits = 2)

frog_testing_rmse <-
  tree_fit %>%
  augment(frog_test) %>%
  rmse(latency, .pred) %>%
  pull(.estimate) %>%
  round(digits = 2)
```

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
tree_res %>%
  collect_metrics() %>% 
  select(.metric, mean, n)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
The RMSE previously was

- `r frog_training_rmse` for the training set
- `r frog_testing_rmse` for test set
:::
:::

. . .

Remember that:

⚠️ the training set gives you overly optimistic metrics

⚠️ the test set is precious

## Evaluating model performance `r hexes("tune")`

```{r}
# Save the assessment set results
ctrl_frog <- control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
tree_res <- fit_resamples(tree_wflow, frog_folds, control = ctrl_frog)

tree_preds <- collect_predictions(tree_res)
tree_preds
```

## 

```{r}
tree_preds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(latency, .pred, color = id)) + 
  geom_abline(lty = 2, col = "gray", size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  coord_obs_pred()
```

## Random forest 🌳🌲🌴🌵🌳🌳🌴🌲🌵🌴🌳🌵

- Ensemble many decision tree models

- All the trees vote! 🗳️

- Bootstrap aggregating + random feature selection

. . .

- Often works well without tuning hyperparameters (more on this tomorrow!), as long as there are enough trees

## Create a random forest model `r hexes("parsnip")`

```{r}
rf_spec <- rand_forest(trees = 1000, mode = "regression")
rf_spec
```

## Create a random forest model `r hexes("workflows")`

```{r}
rf_wflow <- workflow(latency ~ ., rf_spec)
rf_wflow
```

## Your turn {transition="slide-in"}

*Use `fit_resamples()` and `rf_wflow` to:*

-   *keep predictions*
-   *compute metrics*
-   *plot true vs. predicted values*

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 5, id = "try-fit-resamples")
```

## Evaluating model performance `r hexes("tune")`

```{r}
ctrl_frog <- control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)

# Random forest uses random numbers so set the seed first

set.seed(2)
rf_res <- fit_resamples(rf_wflow, frog_folds, control = ctrl_frog)
collect_metrics(rf_res)
```

## 

```{r}
collect_predictions(rf_res) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(latency, .pred, color = id)) + 
  geom_abline(lty = 2, col = "gray", size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  coord_obs_pred()
```

## How can we compare multiple model workflows at once? {background-image="images/Hatching-process.jpg"}


## Evaluate a workflow set

```{r}
workflow_set(list(latency ~ .), list(tree_spec, rf_spec))
```

## Evaluate a workflow set

```{r}
workflow_set(list(latency ~ .), list(tree_spec, rf_spec)) %>%
  workflow_map("fit_resamples", resamples = frog_folds)
```

## Evaluate a workflow set

```{r}
workflow_set(list(latency ~ .), list(tree_spec, rf_spec)) %>%
  workflow_map("fit_resamples", resamples = frog_folds) %>%
  rank_results()
```

The first metric of the metric set is used for ranking. Use `rank_metric` to change that.

. . .

Lots more available with workflow sets, like `collect_metrics()`, `autoplot()` methods, and more!


## Your turn {transition="slide-in"}

![](images/parsnip-flagger.jpg){.absolute top="0" right="0" width="150" height="150"}

*When do you think a workflow set would be useful?*

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 3, id = "discuss-workflow-sets")
```

## The final fit `r hexes("tune")`

Suppose that we are happy with our random forest model.

Let's verify our performance using the test set.

. . .

We've shown you `fit()` and `predict()` (+ `augment()`) but there is a shortcut:

```{r}
# frog_split has train + test info
final_fit <- last_fit(rf_wflow, frog_split) 

final_fit
```

## What is in `final_fit`? `r hexes("tune")`

```{r}
collect_metrics(final_fit)
```

. . .

These are metrics computed with the **test** set

## What is in `final_fit`? `r hexes("tune")`

```{r}
collect_predictions(final_fit)
```

. . .

These are predictions for the **test** set

## 

```{r}
collect_predictions(final_fit) %>%
  ggplot(aes(latency, .pred)) + 
  geom_abline(lty = 2, col = "deeppink4", size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  coord_obs_pred()
```

## What is in `final_fit`? `r hexes("tune")`

```{r}
extract_workflow(final_fit)
```

. . .

Use this for **prediction** on new data, like for deploying

## Why choose just one `final_fit`? `r hexes("stacks")`

## Building a model stack `r hexes("stacks")`

```{r load-stacks}
library(stacks)
```

1) Define candidate members
2) Initialize a data stack object
3) Iteratively add candidate ensemble members to the data stack
4) Evaluate how to combine their predictions
5) Fit candidate ensemble members with non-zero stacking coefficients
6) Predict on new data!

## Building a model stack `r hexes("stacks")`

```{r}
stack_ctrl <- control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE, save_workflow = TRUE)
```

## Building a model stack `r hexes("stacks")`

1) **Define candidate members**

Start out with a linear regression:

```{r}
lr_res <- 
  # define model spec
  linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  # add to workflow
  workflow(preprocessor = latency ~ .) %>%
  # fit to resamples
  fit_resamples(frog_folds, control = stack_ctrl)
```

## Building a model stack `r hexes("stacks")`

```{r}
lr_res
```

## Building a model stack `r hexes("stacks")`

Then, a random forest:

```{r}
rf_res <- 
  # define model spec
  rand_forest() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  # add to workflow
  workflow(preprocessor = latency ~ .) %>%
  # fit to resamples
  fit_resamples(frog_folds, control = stack_ctrl)
```

## Building a model stack `r hexes("stacks")`

```{r}
rf_res
```

## Building a model stack `r hexes("stacks")`

2) Initialize a data stack object

<!-- point out analogy with `ggplot()` constructor -->

```{r}
st <- stacks()

st
```

## Building a model stack `r hexes("stacks")`

3) Iteratively add candidate ensemble members to the data stack

```{r}
st <- st %>%
  add_candidates(lr_res) %>%
  add_candidates(rf_res)

st
```


## Building a model stack `r hexes("stacks")`

4) Evaluate how to combine their predictions

```{r}
st <- st %>%
  blend_predictions()

st
```

## Building a model stack `r hexes("stacks")`

5) Fit candidate ensemble members with non-zero stacking coefficients

```{r}
st <- st %>%
  fit_members()

st
```

## Building a model stack `r hexes("stacks")`

5) Predict on new data!

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| collapse: false
#| comment: NULL
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5.1
#| fig-align: 'center'
frog_test %>%
  select(latency) %>%
  bind_cols(predict(st, frog_test)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(latency, .pred)) + 
  geom_abline(lty = 2, 
              col = "deeppink4", 
              size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  coord_obs_pred()
```
