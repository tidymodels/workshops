## Welcome

These are the materials for workshops on [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/). This workshop provides an introduction to machine learning with R using the tidymodels framework, a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) principles. We will build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models. Along the way, we'll learn about key concepts in machine learning including overfitting, resampling, and feature engineering. Learners will gain knowledge about good predictive modeling practices, as well as hands-on experience using tidymodels packages like parsnip, rsample, recipes, yardstick, tune, and workflows.

## Is this workshop for me? <img src='slides/images/parsnip-flagger.jpg' align="right" height="150" />

This course assumes intermediate R knowledge. This workshop is for you if:

- You can use the magrittr pipe `%>%` and/or native pipe `|>`
- You are familiar with functions from dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2
- You can read data into R, transform and reshape data, and make a wide variety of graphs

We expect participants to have some exposure to basic statistical concepts, but NOT intermediate or expert familiarity with modeling or machine learning.


## Preparation

Please join the workshop with a computer that has the following installed (all available for free):

- A recent version of R, available at <https://cran.r-project.org/>
- A recent version of RStudio Desktop (RStudio Desktop Open Source License), available at <https://www.rstudio.com/download>
- The following R packages, which you can install from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "tidymodels", "rpart", 
                   "ranger", "vetiver", "rpart.plot"))
```
