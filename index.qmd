## Welcome

These are the materials for workshops on [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) offered at [posit::conf(2023)](https://posit.co/conference/). The tidymodels framework is a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) principles. This website hosts the materials for both the _Introduction to tidymodels_ and _Advanced tidymodels_ courses.

_Introduction to tidymodels_ will teach you core tidymodels packages and their uses: data splitting/resampling with rsample, model fitting with parsnip, measuring model performance with yardstick, and basic pre-processing with recipes. Time permitting, you'll be introduced to model optimization using the tune package. You'll learn tidymodels syntax as well as the process of predictive modeling for tabular data.

_Advanced tidymodels_ will teach you about model optimization using the tune and finetune packages, including racing and iterative methods. You'll be able to do more sophisticated feature engineering with recipes. Time permitting, model ensembles via stacking will be introduced. This course is focused on the analysis of tabular data and does not include deep learning methods.

Depending on your background, one of _Introduction to tidymodels_ or _Advanced tidymodels_ might serve you better than the other.

###  Introduction to tidymodels

This workshop is for you if you:

-   are comfortable using tidyverse packages to read data into R, transform and reshape data, and make a variety of graphs, and
-   have had some exposure to basic statistical concepts such as linear models, residuals, etc.

Intermediate or expert familiarity with modeling or machine learning is not required. Interested students who have intermediate or expert familiarity with modeling or machine learning may be interested in the _Advanced tidymodels_ workshop.

### Advanced tidymodels

This workshop is for you if you:

-  have the prerequisite skills listed for the _Introduction to tidymodels_ workshops, 
-  have used tidymodels packages like recipes, rsample, and parsnip, and
-  have some experience with evaluating statistical models using resampling techniques like v-fold cross-validation or the bootstrap.

Participants who are new to tidymodels or machine learning will benefit from taking the _Introduction to tidymodels_ workshop before joining this one. Participants who have completed the "Introduction to tidymodels" workshop will be well-prepared for this course.

## Preparation

The process to set up your computer for either workshop will look the same. Please join the workshop with a computer that has the following installed (all available for free):

-   A recent version of R, available at <https://cran.r-project.org/>
-   A recent version of RStudio Desktop (RStudio Desktop Open Source License, at least v2022.02), available at <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
-   The following R packages, which you can install from the R console:

```{r}
#| label: installs
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Install the packages for the workshop
pkgs <- 
  c("bonsai", "doParallel", "embed", "finetune", "lightgbm", "lme4",
    "plumber", "probably", "ranger", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "rules",
    "splines2", "stacks", "textrecipes", "tidymodels", "vetiver", "remotes")

install.packages(pkgs)
```

If you're a Windows user and encounter an error message during installation noting a missing Rtools installation, install Rtools using the installer linked [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

## Slides

These slides are designed to use with live teaching and are published for workshop participants' convenience. There are not meant as standalone learning materials. For that, we recommend [tidymodels.org](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/) and [*Tidy Modeling with R*](https://www.tmwr.org/).

## Code

Quarto files (version `r system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE)`) for working along [are available on GitHub](https://github.com/tidymodels/workshops/tree/main/classwork). (Don't worry if you haven't used Quarto before; it will feel familiar to R Markdown users.)
